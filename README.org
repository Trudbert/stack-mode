=stack-mode= hopes to be a fully-featured Stack Exchange mode for
Emacs 24+ using version 2.1 (and subsequent versions as available) of
the Stack Exchange API.

For a full list of planned features and a sketch of high-level
implementation (no elisp, yet), see [[file://stack-mode.org]].

This README will eventually hold an extremely high-level feature list
and details on installation and configuration.
